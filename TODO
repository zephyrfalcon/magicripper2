# TODO

- Extract rulings? This might be useful, although it does not necessarily make
  sense to store them in the same XML files as the card data.

- Split cards: Some sets (like Invasion) use separate multiverse ids for each
  side, which is fine. Other sets (like Apocalypse) have split cards that for
  some reason use the *same* multiverse id for both sides. This is a problem
  because currently only the rules for one side are extracted. In order to
  make this work, we'd need to have a way to fetch the HTML for both sides,
  and somehow assign them different ids.

  Different HTML can be fetched by using a parameter in the URL:

  2010-10-29: This is in progress; I'm not sure yet how to handle these. In
  any case, the multiverseids of the split cards, and the names of their
  parts, were added to special.py.

  The XML should contain an entry for each part. The name should be the actual
  name of the part; the rules text should only be that of the part, etc.
  However, there should also be some indication that this is part of a split
  card.

- Some cards have alternate art versions that have the same multiverse id.
  When we extract images, this will become a problem.

- What to do with misprints? For example, Squall has a manacost of 2G
  everywhere, except in Starter 1999, where the printed card has a cost of 1G.
  (Oracle still shows 2G for this card; I assume this is a correction.)
  Magicripper now uses the Oracle as the main source of information, so in
  S99.xml Squall will be 2G, where it used to be 1G. Do we need to keep this
  information somewhere, somehow? Maybe a #misprint tag? :-]
